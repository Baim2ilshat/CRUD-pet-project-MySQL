# Notes app pet project

Hello there! It's my small project that use SQL and java (also there are python version) to contain, adding, searching and deleting notes.
Requirements:
1) IntelliJ IDEA (optional)
2) MySQL (you can download it here https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)
3) MySQL Connector Jar (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)

In the case of sucsessful compiling you see something like this:
